# Python Challenges
Below are some challenges to help you get started as you start learning Python.

In these challenges you will practice topics including:

1. Using variables (`x = 5`)
2. Using conditionals (`if x == 5: ... else: ...`)
3. Using different types of loops (`for ___ in ___:` and `while x < 5:`)
4. Using lists to hold data (`myBackpack = ['pencil', 'notebook']`)
5. Creating functions that use all of the above (`def myFunction(): ...`)

## Beginner Opportunities
Below are tutorials that you can use to learn about each of the topics:

### Variables

### Conditionals

### Loops

### [Lists](https://github.com/carlshan/intro_to_computer_programming/blob/master/Lists/Lists_Tutorial.md)

### Functions

## Intermediate/Advanced Opportunities
Here are some advanced options to practice your Python programming skills:

0. Visit [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/), a website containing intermediate-to-advanced exercises for Python.

1. Visit [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), a website containing tons of programming challenges. Make an account and try using Python to solve some of their exercises. Below is an example of a problem to get you started:
    > **[PROBLEM 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4):** A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
    > 
    > Write a program to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
    
    
2. Visit [Project Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/), a website that contains challenges combining programming and biology. Make an account to solve some problems from this page: [Problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).


3. Visit [Google's Python Exercises](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic) to solve some of the challenges they give their employees as they are learning Python.

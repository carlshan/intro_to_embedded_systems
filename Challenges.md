# Python Challenges
Below are some challenges to help you get started as you start learning Python.

## Beginner Challenges
TBD

## Advanced Opportunities
Here are some advanced options to practice your Python programming skills:

1. Visit [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), a website containing tons of programming challenges. Make an account and try using Python to solve some of their exercises. Below is an example of a problem to get you started:
    > **[PROBLEM 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4):** A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
    
    > Write a program to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
    
    
2. Visit [Project Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/), a website that contains challenges combining programming and biology. Make an account to solve some problems from this page: [Problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).


3. Visit [Google's Python Exercises](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic) to solve some of the challenges they give their employees as they are learning Python.
